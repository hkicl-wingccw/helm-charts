- commonAnnotations
- commonLabels
- imagePullSecret
- extraDeploy
- resources.requests
- resources.limits
- livenessProbe
- readinessProbe
- customLivenessProbe
- customReadinessProbe
- podLabels
- affinity
- nodeSelector
- tolerations (that would override the default one)
- podAnnotations
- priorityClassName
- lifecycleHooks
- sidecars
- initContainers
- extraEnvVars
- extraEnvVarsCM
- extraEnvVarsSecret
- command (which would override the default one)
- args (which would override the default one)
- extraVolumes
